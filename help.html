SUJOK:<br>
      <br>
Sujok is a Korean healing method, based on very simple system of body
projection on the palms and the feet. The theory behind claims, that the
whole body is "projected" on the palms and the feet, and this
projection could be used  both to diagnose and trigger healing processes
in the respective organ or system. For more information, refer to Sujok
learning materials in the web or books.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
HOW TO USE THE ATLAS:<br>
      <br>
First, identify the organ or system, which have an issue. You don't
need to know what exactly the problem is on the first place, just where
it is. For example - pain in the hearth area.
      </tt>
      <tt class="letterText"> <br>
Then point out in the atlas the respective area of the body and see how
it is projected on the hand. For best results work separately on both
hands, but you can choose only the more convenient one as well:<br>
      </tt>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><tt class="letterText"><img
 src="data/help02.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 480px; height: 390px;"></tt><br>
      </div>
      <tt class="letterText"> <br>
To identify the exact point of projection, scan the area on the palm
with diagnostic probe by gently pushing in place or making small
circular movements. Finding a painful point is an indication, that that
is the projection of  the problematic organ (could be more than one
point). Instead of the special sujok probe, any object with the correct
form could be used, even a finger (even though with lower resolution
than the probe). Don't use sharp objects, which can hurt or cause pain!<br>
      </tt>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><tt class="letterText"><img
 src="data/help03.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 480px; height: 497px;"></tt><br>
      </div>
      <tt class="letterText"> <br>
Once found, the point needs to be stimulated in order to trigger the
body to perform a healing process in the corresponding organs. The
stimmulation  in sujok could be done in many ways - pressure, puncture,
moxa heating, magnets or seeds. The easiest way is just to massage the
point with pressure and circular movements, done with the diagnostics
probe (or other suitable object or finger, as in the diagnostic mode).
The massage should be strong enough,  but shouldn't feel uncomfortable.
Continue until the pain in the point reduces or disappears:<br>
      </tt>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><tt class="letterText"><img
 src="data/help04.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 480px; height: 472px;"></tt><br>
      </div>
      <tt class="letterText"> <br>
OTHER EXAMPLES:<br>
      <br>
Sometimes the cause is known - for example viral infection with flu,
but one can not realize where to search, as the virus is everywhere in
the body. Then the most symptomatic organs are the chosen - in the case
of flu: the nose, the throat, eventually the ears.<br>
      <br>
Internal organs are also projected on the hands and feets, but the
points are on different depth. For example - the points of prostate and
the lower gut can be in the same area on the palm, but the scanning will
reveal only the point of the problematic organ and it needs to be later
stimulated.<br>

are made. Use the atlas on your own risk.</tt><tt class="letterText">
The atlas is developed as a programming excercise, not to proclaim the
sujok method. The "Sujok Interactive Atlas" is an unique non-discrete accupuncture 
atlas, in which there is complete area to area projection 
(instead of limited number of points, as the other computer programs work).<br>
